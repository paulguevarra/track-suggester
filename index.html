          <h1>We Suggest: Java/Android</h1>
          <img class="sug" src="img/java.png" alt="java">
          <p>Java is a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.</p>
          <br>
          <img class="sug" src="img/android.png" alt="android">
          <p>Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on Linux and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

          <h1>We Suggest: C#/.NET</h1>
          <img class="sug" src="img/csharp.png" alt="cSharp">
          <p>C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.</p>

          <img class="sug" src="img/net.png" alt="net">
          <p>.NET is a software framework developed by Microsoft and primarily used on Microsoft Windows. The .NET framework is used to create desktop, mobile, and web applications that run on various devices. It compiles and executes programs written in the C# and Visual Basic languages. C# and .NET are typically used by large enterprises, government agencies, and companies serving enterprises and government clients.</p>

          <h1>We Suggest: CSS/Design</h1>
          <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the visual layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.</p>
          <br>
          <img class="sug" src="img/design.png" alt="Design">
          <p>Web design is a process of conceptualizing, planning, and building a collection of electronic files that determine the layout, colors, text styles, structure, graphics, images, and use of interactive features that deliver pages to your site visitors. Web Design is a crucial component in web development, and students who learn design will be able to engineer positive and interactive user experiences through innovative interfaces.</p>
